Go to the secret message folder, make sure you have the grid view (and not the list view) and files are sorted by name.
Now being in the folder SecretMemoryTest, run the file RevealMessage.py
Take a look at the secret message folder now, and tell me whether it reminds you of something :P !!
Don't get this one wrong, this one is way too easy...
